Hey guys,

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,730
welcome to Day 6 of 100 Days of code. And well done from making it this

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,983
far.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,200
So today we're going to talk about code blocks and indentation as well as

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,540
functions and also a different flavor from the for loops that we saw yesterday.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,110
Today

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,580
we're going to talk about while loops as well. And to learn all of these things,

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,530
we're going to use the help of something

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,930
that's very similar to Karel the robot.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,409
And this is something I use when I first learnt how to code

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,950
and it's one of my favorite tools for learning programming

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,130
especially as we get into more difficult concepts like functions and while loops

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,970
et cetera. And by the end of the day, we're going to be writing the code

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,210
that's required to instruct our little robot to be able to complete any

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,390
randomly generated maze. So that's the goal

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,430
and if you head over to the next lesson,

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,820
let's get started and let's start learning about some of these things.
